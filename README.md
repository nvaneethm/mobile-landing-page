# üé¨ Movie Landing Page

Responsive, smooth, and performant movie listing app using **Vite + React + TypeScript + SCSS**.

---

#  Requirements Met

 **1. Vertical Scroll Only, No Horizontal Scroll + Virtualized Optimized Grid**

- The movie grid **only scrolls vertically**, no horizontal overflow.
- Layout is **grid-based** with proper `overflow-y: scroll` and restricted `overflow-x: hidden`.
- Virtualization is optimized by **lazy rendering** using **IntersectionObserver** ‚Äì only images in view are loaded.

  **2. Lazy Loading of Content**

- **First page** is loaded on app start.
- **Next pages** (`page2.json`, `page3.json`, etc.) are fetched **seamlessly** as the user scrolls **near the bottom**.
- **Skeleton loaders** are shown while new data is being appended ‚Äî **no blocking spinner or scroll freeze**.

  **3. Client-Side Search Without API**

- Search is implemented **purely client-side** using **Context API + useReducer**.
- Already loaded movie data is **filtered instantly** based on the search query.
- **No page reloads**, **no API calls**, and **results are shown live** in the main view itself.

  **4. Focus / Long Press Scale Animation**

- When a card is **hovered**, **focused** (keyboard), or **long pressed** (touch devices), a **smooth scale effect** is applied.
- CSS transitions are handled efficiently for a buttery-smooth experience.

  **5. Arrow Key Navigation**

- **Custom `useArrowNavigation` hook** is implemented.
- Users can **navigate between movie cards** using **Arrow keys (‚¨ÖÔ∏è ‚û°Ô∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏è)**, without any third-party library.

  **6. Proper Paginated API Handling**

- Only **page1.json** is fetched initially.
- As the user scrolls and approaches the end of the grid, **next page is requested dynamically**.
- **No preloading of all pages at once**.
- Fetches are **smooth**, **non-blocking**, and **do not interrupt scrolling**.

  **7. Proper Data Flow Management**

- **Context API** + **useReducer** is used to manage:
  - Search state (query, suggestions, search mode)
  - Grid state (infinite scroll trigger)
- Local caching of pages in **localStorage** with **TTL** expiration.
- Centralized hooks for data fetching (`useMovies`), scrolling (`useInfiniteScroll`), and arrow navigation.

  **8. Performance Optimizations**

- **Lazy loading** of images (only load images as they come into view).
- **Memoization** (`React.memo`) of cards (`MovieCard` component).
- **Split responsibilities** across hooks and components.
- **No unnecessary re-renders** thanks to careful dependency management in hooks.
- **Preconnects external resources** (fonts, assets) for faster first paint (FCP/LCP).
